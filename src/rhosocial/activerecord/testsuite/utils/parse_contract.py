# src/rhosocial/activerecord/testsuite/utils/parse_contract.py
"""The shared parse-vs-format round-trip sweep for typed-column contracts.

Every dialect's ``parse_type`` is the introspection inverse of its
``format_data_type_<name>`` renderings. Two invariants make a dialect
coherent, and this module checks both over a backend's full type registry:

**String stability** -- parsing a rendering and re-rendering the answer
must produce the identical string. Whatever ``parse`` answers, its answer
must name the same storage the server holds, or the schema differ would
report a change no one made.

**Class honesty** -- the answer is either the declared instance itself
(``parsed == declared``, the round-trip-equal case) or the *documented*
answer class for that declaration: a backend that widens a declaration on
the way in (four integer widths stored as one integer type, a JSONB
concept stored as the JSON type) answers with the concept that was *not*
widened, and that answer is recorded here once per backend rather than
being re-derived by every test.

What the sweep deliberately does **not** do:

* It does not assert anything about a class the registry cannot construct
  or cannot render -- those are the round-trip matrix's own lists
  (``UNCONSTRUCTIBLE`` / pinned non-renders) and have their own tests.
* It does not guess what ``CustomType`` should parse to -- a
  ``CustomType``'s raw is caller-supplied text that may happen to be a
  word the dialect knows, so the class is skipped by default.
* It does not accept a ``CustomType`` answer for a rendered word. A
  dialect that renders a word its own parse does not model has a gap on
  one side or the other, and the sweep says so instead of blessing it.

    """Sweep *registry* and return the parse round-trip failures as text.

    Args:
        dialect: the dialect whose ``parse_type`` is under test.
        registry: a mapping of fully-qualified name to class, as the
            backend's round-trip module keeps it (``REGISTERED`` or
            ``ALL_CLASSES``). Only concrete ``DataType`` subclasses are
            swept.
        widening: the backend's documented answer table,
            ``{declared class name: answer}``. An entry here asserts the
            parse answers with exactly that class and that the answer
            re-renders the identical string, **unless** the value is a
            ``(class name, expected string)`` tuple: that form is for the
            documented answers whose re-render deliberately *differs* --
            a backend that stores a word as its documented alias (Snowflake
            writes TINYINT and stores INTEGER) or completes a bare word
            with the server's default (its bare VARCHAR *is*
            VARCHAR(16777216)). The tuple pins both the answer class and
            the string it re-renders, so the alias is recorded as a
            reviewable fact rather than leaking out as string instability.
            The reason for each entry belongs in the backend's test file
            next to the table, where a reader can check it.
        skip: class names to leave out of the sweep entirely, in addition
            to the built-in ``CustomType`` skip. Use it only for classes
            that are not column types at all (a CAST target, say) and say
            why in the test file.

    Returns:
        A list of human-readable failures. An empty list is the contract
        met; each element names the class, the rendering and the fault,
        so a red test points straight at the offending entry instead of
        leaving the reader to bisect.
