# src/rhosocial/activerecord/testsuite/feature/query/typed_column/column_helpers.py
"""Test-side helpers for the typed-column contracts, and the canonical entry list.

The production path is ``base/field_proxy.py``: ``Model.c.<field>`` asks the
model for the field's column-type declaration (dialect-free), then the field
accessor selects the class the model's backend answers. This module mirrors
that selection step for a bare annotation, so a contract test can build a
column without declaring a model.

``COMMON_TYPES`` is the contract-side canonical list of the common Python
types every backend must answer for. It lives here, not in the framework: the
framework resolves by walking whatever keys a backend's table declares, and
the required key set is a contract the tests state and hold each backend to.

Deliberately **not** a fallback: an annotation the selection cannot classify
raises :class:`ColumnTypeResolutionError` exactly as ``Model.c.<field>``
would, so a contract test that builds a column from a bad annotation fails
here for the same reason the model would.
